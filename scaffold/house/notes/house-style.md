# House style

How this house prefers its work done. Practice, not authority: the contract
says what an agent may do, this note says how the house likes it done —
small reviewable branches, merges that keep history, failures said out
loud, nothing left unpushed or undocumented. The framework wrote it and the
owner changes it, in the owner's own turn; an agent that thinks a line here
is wrong files against it in [[household-backlog]] rather than editing it.

**Push back when something smells off.** If the owner proposes something
over-engineered, premature, or unnecessary, say so — clearly, with reasoning.
A good "I don't think we need this yet, here's why" is worth more than
agreeable silence.

**Never silently skip failures.** If a command, tool, or auth step fails, say
so immediately. Observed failures are work: fix them, file them, or ask for
help.

**Plan before you act.** In interactive sessions, explain the plan first —
what changes, why, and the risks. Wait for approval before writing code.
Permission to run without confirmation prompts is not permission to skip
human approval on decisions.

**Test before you commit; start narrow.** Begin with the smallest checks that
exercise the change, then broaden. A commit that breaks relevant tests is
worse than no commit. If tests don't exist for your change, write them.

**Doc-check before you commit.** If you changed behavior, check whether a note
in `notes/` needs updating.

**Comments carry constraints, not narrative.** The ideal is no comments at
all. Delete the comment and ask whether a competent editor could now
reintroduce a defect the comment was preventing; if yes it stays, otherwise
it goes. No decorative separators, no banners, no boxes.

**Cite a branch by its SHA.** In notes and queue entries, write a branch as
`` `name` (`sha`) `` on first mention. Branch names are borrowed; SHAs are not.
Do not add a SHA to remote-tracking refs, repositories, or credential keys.

**Merge, don't squash.** `gh pr merge --merge`. Keep branch commits clean
before merging; the branch is the narrative.

**Small PRs, and never stacked.** Every PR is cut fresh from a synced `main`
and stands on its own. One reviewable idea per PR. If you find yourself
needing a stack, stop and say so — it is a scoping mistake surfacing late.

**Always work on a branch.** `main` is somewhere you merge into, never
somewhere you commit. `<name>/<short-topic>`, kebab-case, what the work does.

**Unpushed is invisible.** Report work as *pushed* or *unpushed*, never as
"done". Before asking anyone to look at a PR, `git rev-list --count @{u}..HEAD`
must be `0` — and a branch with no upstream reports nothing rather than
everything, so check `git branch -vv` too.

**No footers.** No AI attribution, no `Co-Authored-By` lines, no emoji
markers. Clean conventional commit messages only.

**Know when to abort.** If you're fundamentally blocked — missing credentials,
service down, permissions error — say so plainly, on its own line, and stop.
Silent non-accomplishment is worse than visible failure.

**Clean up before you leave.** `git status` on every repo you touched; push or
say what is unpushed and why; update your scratchpad; write down what you
learned in the right `notes/<topic>.md`, not what you did. The next session —
you or a housemate — starts from a known-clean state.
