# example

Home base for the agents of **example**. Part contract, part notebook,
part work queue: the agents read their rules here, record what they learn
here, and take work from here.

Started from [house-framework](https://github.com/olavostauros/house-framework)
on 2026-01-01.

## Who lives here

See `roster.tsv` and the "Who lives here" section of `AGENTS.md`. Add an
agent with `house agent add <name> --house . --role <role> [--owns <dir>/]`.

Builders work on `<name>/<topic>` branches and open pull requests into
`main`; none merges. The owner files work into `notes/work-queue.md`,
addressed to one agent, and that agent takes it from the top.

## Usage

```bash
cd ~/Work/example
mise run welcome                       # orientation and setup health
mise run test                          # household checks
mise run install-hooks                 # commit guard for the work tree
eval "$(mise run -q agent-env <name>)" # become an agent, in the shell that commits
```

## How it is laid out

- **`AGENTS.md`** — the house contract and the real documentation: house
  rules, any domain rule sets, and the authority model that says what an
  agent may do without asking.
- **`roster.tsv`** — who counts as an agent. Read by the guard, `agent-env`
  and `welcome`.
- **`notes/`** — shared notes, plaintext. Identity in `<name>.md`, work in
  `work-queue.md`, proposed changes to the household in
  `household-backlog.md`.
- **`hooks/`** — `agent-identity`, the pre-commit guard.
- **`.mise/tasks/`** — the household's own machinery.
- **`test/`** — the household's own checks, run by `mise run test`.

## Signing

Whether commits here are signed is the machine's git config, not the
house's. `mise run welcome` reports it under `== signing ==`, with the key.
When they are signed, expect three things:

- **A passphrase prompt during a `house` command or a commit is for that
  key.** The dialog is GnuPG's: it names the key and not the terminal that
  asked. `house init` says so before its bootstrap commit; nothing else
  in the house opens one on its own.
- **An agent's commit is signed with the owner's key.** `agent-env` sets
  the author and committer only, so a commit made as an agent is authored
  by the agent and verifies as the owner. Per-agent keys are the backlog
  entry in `notes/household-backlog.md`, not a switch.
- **The prompt repeats.** With no `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`, gpg-agent
  caches a passphrase for 10 minutes and drops it after 2 hours, so a long
  session asks more than once. A longer `default-cache-ttl` and
  `max-cache-ttl` there, or a pinentry backed by the login keyring, stops
  it; both are machine setup, outside the house.

To stop signing for this repository alone: `git -C ~/Work/example config
commit.gpgsign false`, in the owner's own turn. An agent never does that: a
commit that stalls on a passphrase prompt is reported, not worked around.

## What is not here yet

Not here yet: no git-crypt on `notes/`, no per-agent GitHub identity
or signing key, no mail, no chat, no CI wake-ups.

None is filed: the owner files the ones this house wants in
`notes/household-backlog.md`, one at a time, and each becomes a dated
widening in `AGENTS.md` when it is granted.

<!-- house:decide: which of these this house wants, in what order, and which
it never will; cut the rest of the list. -->
