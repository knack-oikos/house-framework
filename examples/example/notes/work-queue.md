# Work queue

The owner files entries, each addressed to one agent; that agent takes its
top `queued` one and sets it `in-progress`. States: `queued` → `in-progress`
→ `pr-open` → `done`, or `dropped` with a reason. Newest at the bottom; rank
by editing order.

Entry shape:

```
## <short title>
- state: queued | in-progress | pr-open | done | dropped
- agent: <name>
- filed: YYYY-MM-DD by <who>
- scope: <one reviewable idea, with what is out of scope named>
- branch: `<name>/<topic>` (`<sha>`) — base `main` (`<sha>`)
- pr: <url once open>
- review: <verdict at <sha>, with the comment's url, if the house has a reviewer>
- notes: <what the agent found>
```
